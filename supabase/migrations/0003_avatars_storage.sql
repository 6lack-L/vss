-- avatars bucket — lets people upload a profile picture instead of only
-- pasting a link. Objects live under <user-id>/…, and the policies below are
-- the security boundary: a signed-in user may only write inside their own
-- folder. The bucket's own size and mime limits are a second layer, enforced
-- by storage before RLS is even consulted.
